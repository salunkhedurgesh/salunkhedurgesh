# 👋 Hi, I'm Durgesh Haribhau Salunkhe

I DO NOT TRUST GITHUB WITH MY CODE STARTING MAY 2025:

I am working to have my server with static IP via Gitea

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Learning Algorithms and Systems Laboratory (LASA)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lasa/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), working with Prof. Aude Billard.

## 🧠 What I Do

My research focuses on integrating **kinematic insights into learning-based motion planning**, enabling robots to generalize across tasks, morphologies, and constraints. My recent work explores:
- ⚙️ **Cuspidal and Redundant Robots** for real-time trajectory planning in commercial robots
- 🌐 **Geometric Algebra** for intuitive robot kinematic analysis
- 🔁 **Transfer Learning** in imitation setups
- 📈 **Dynamical Systems** for stable pose and orientation control

## 🎓 Academic Path

- 🧪 **PhD in Robotics**, [LS2N Lab](https://www.ls2n.fr/), CNRS, Nantes  
  *Cuspidal Robots: theoretical study, classification, and applications to commercial robots*  
  Supervised by **Philippe Wenger** and **Damien Chablat**

- 🎓 **Double Erasmus Mundus Master’s** in Robotics Engineering  
  *Thesis: Optimisation of parallel mechanisms for otological surgery*
  *DFKI Germany · CHU Nantes · UNIGE Genova*

## 📣 Talks and Collaborations

I’ve presented invited talks on:
- **Cuspidality in Industrial Robots**
- **Geometric Representations in Motion Learning**
- **Safe and Generalizable Robot Planning**
